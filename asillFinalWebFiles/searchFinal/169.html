But Lynes was not only daring with his gift, he was hopeful that one day photos of nude men, some of whom are posing together, would not only be allowed to be seen but would be seen without prejudice or fear of prosecution.</p><p>Decades later, that day has come: Lynes' work is on display in an exhibition titled "<a href="https://discovernewfields.org/calendar/sensualsexualsocial-photography-george-platt-lynes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sensual/Sexual/Social: The Photography of George Platt Lynes</a>," taking place at the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. The exhibition features not only male nudes but Lynes' more mainstream photos of fashion, ballet and portraits.</p><p>"When gifting his work, Lynes stipulated to Kinsey that he did not want his work 'stuck in a dusty archive' forever," said Rebecca Fasman, manager of traveling exhibitions at the Kinsey Institute and co-curator of the exhibition. "We see this exhibition, as well as the ones that came before it, as the realization of Lynes' desire for his work, and especially the works that he liked the most, to be seen."</p></div><div class="float-right one-half"><figure class="media image" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img alt="Portrait by George Platt Lynes." src="https://www.iu.edu/~images/dams/ktevwq9wvf_w768.jpg"/><a class="print-quality-image" href="https://www.iu.edu/~images/dams/ktevwq9wvf_actual.jpg" title="Click to view the print quality image">View print quality image</a><figcaption itemprop="caption"><span class="caption-text">Man with Towel: George Platt Lynes (American, 1907&#8211;1955), Name Withheld, 1943, gelatin silver print, 7-1/2 &#215; 9 in.</span> <span class="caption-credit">Photo is from the Collections of the Kinsey Institute, Indiana University. © Estate of George Platt Lynes.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text"><p>As a photographer in the 1930s and '40s, Lynes had an illustrious career photographing New York fashion, celebrity portraits and the New York City Ballet. He also worked as the head of Vogue magazine's West Coast studio in Los Angeles, photographing some of the most well-known celebrities of the time.</p><p>But Lynes is most well-known today for his photographs of male nudes and his use of lighting and posing. Although the photos are revered today, the climate of the 1930s to 1950s required Lynes' work to be shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>"It does not come as a surprise that, during his time, being openly gay had negative legal and societal ramifications, so Lynes kept his sexual orientation, and the male nude photographs, secret, except for his close circle of friends," Fasman said.</p><p>One of those friends was Alfred Kinsey, founder of the Kinsey Institute, whom Lynes met in the 1940s. Kinsey, who was researching human sexuality at the time, was particularly taken with Lynes' male nude photography.</p><p>Lynes became sick in the years following their initial meeting. Fearing many museums would not be interested in the nude portraits, which he considered his most important work, or that the photos would be destroyed, Lynes decided to give a majority of his work to the Kinsey Institute.</p><p>As part of the gift, Lynes stipulated that the identities of some of his male models remain confidential in order to protect them.</p><p>"Lynes' choice to trust Dr. Kinsey and his institute with this body of work that could have been incredibly damaging to a number of people is reflective of the trust that the two men had for each other and the understanding of the risks that they both took in producing and protecting these vital works," Fasman said.</p></div><div class="float-left one-half"><figure class="media image" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img alt="Portrait of Alfred Kinsey." src="https://www.iu.edu/~images/dams/lo2hls.jpg"/><a class="print-quality-image" href="https://www.iu.edu/~images/dams/lo2hls.jpg" title="Click to view the print quality image">View print quality image</a><figcaption itemprop="caption"><span class="caption-text">George Platt Lynes (American, 1907&#8211;1955), Portrait of Alfred Kinsey, 1950, gelatin silver print, 7 &#215; 9 in.</span> <span class="caption-credit">Photo is from the Collections of the Kinsey Institute, Indiana University. © Estate of George Platt Lynes.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text"><p>Although nudes are a part of the Newfields exhibition, Fasman said it is not a sexually explicit exhibition. And while some of the collection has been exhibited in previous shows, many of the pieces are being shown for the first time.</p><p>The exhibition also marks the first time Kinsey has partnered with Newfields. The partnership is part of the institute's effort to create traveling exhibitions in order to increase exposure to its vast collection of art.</p><p>"We are so pleased to have the opportunity to partner with the Kinsey Institute," said Robin Lawrence, manager of curatorial affairs at Newfields. "Not unlike George Platt Lynes, who was a revolutionary spirit, Alfred Kinsey boldly studied and collected these fine works of photography in a period that was brutal to art and lifestyles that were outside of the strict social norms of the time.</p><p>"Newfields is dedicated to creating exceptional experiences for our guests, and this exhibition is truly exceptional. As the largest exhibition of George Platt Lynes to date, we could not be more thrilled to be able to present this in Indiana, a place that is so important to Lynes' legacy thanks to the preservation efforts of the Kinsey Institute, who have been stewards of this collection for 70 years."</p><p>In addition to Lynes' photographs, the exhibition features several different artists who were influenced by Lynes' work, including Herb Ritts, Robert Mapplethorpe and Duane Michals. An interactive component of the exhibition includes a process section offering a hands-on approach to learning about how Lynes physically made his photos. This includes film developing trays and tongs that guests can touch, a puzzle made of reproduced negatives, and a mailbox activity that encourages visitors to type their own personal experiences of both discrimination and support.</p><p>This interactive component aims to encourage the audience to relate Lynes' story to their own story and will urge them to question exclusivity in art.</p><p>"It will hopefully encourage the audience to push back against these narratives of exclusion," Fasman said.</p><p>Admission to "Sensual/Sexual/Social: The Photography of George Platt Lynes" is included with general admission to Newfields. Tickets can be purchased online or at the door. The exhibition will run through Feb. 24.</p><p>This exhibition was curated by Rebecca Fasman, manager of traveling exhibitions at the Kinsey Institute, Indiana University, Robin Lawrence, manager of curatorial affairs at Newfields and Anne Young, manager of rights and reproductions at Newfields.</p></div></div><!-- /.layout --></div></div><div class="section bg-none article-bottom collapsed"><div class="row"><div class="layout"><div class="article-tags">
