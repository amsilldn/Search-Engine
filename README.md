# Search-Engine
### I427 Search Informatics Final Project

This search engine was created in python. It has a corpus of 200 webpages crawled from Indiana University Bloomington's main page. The results are ranked using PageRank and TF-IDF.

http://cgi.soic.indiana.edu/~asill/hoosierSearch.html

The files in the folder labeled asillFinalComputerFiles are all the files used to initially program the search engine and will successfully run on Anaconda Navigator's Spider (providing file and folder locations are correct). The folder labeled asillFinalWebFiles are all the files up on the server that allow for the search engine to return results online. The only shared python file between the two folders is the asillFinalRetriever/hoosierSearchResults.cgi. Helper text files are located in the subfolders.
